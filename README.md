# MultiClassifier-DNN-with-TensorFlow
This is my first MultiClassifier that I have made using the TensorFlow library for python. The data is all generated using a program it is also prepared and converted to values that can be used for TensorFlow.

The purpose of this Deep Neural Network is to predict a students behavior and sort it into three catagories those being Good, Normal, and Bad. It will also graph the results in a bar graph along with the original data.
